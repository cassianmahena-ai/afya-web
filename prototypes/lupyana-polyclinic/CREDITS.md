# Credits and licences

This site was built for Lupyana Polyclinic. The visual language (soft rounded
cards, pill buttons, generous spacing, calm section rhythm) is adapted from a
free template. No template copy, photography, patient stories or clinical
content is reused.

## Design base

- **Pipit — speech and language therapy template** by **8B**
  - Template page: <https://8b.com/templates/pipit/>
  - Source: <https://github.com/8bsite/speech-therapist-website-template>
  - Licence: **MIT** (code)
  - What we reused: layout patterns, spacing scale, rounded/pill component
    language and the general section structure.
  - What we did **not** reuse: all text, the speech-therapy subject matter, the
    purple brand palette, and every photograph.
  - Attribution is kept in the site footer as “Design base: 8B (MIT)” to satisfy
    the MIT licence's copyright-notice requirement. You may remove it only if
    you keep this file with the deployed source, or replace it with the
    licence text below.

## Photography

- **No photographs are included.** Every image slot is a labelled CSS
  placeholder showing its aspect ratio (16:9, 4:3, 3:2 or 1:1).
- When the clinic supplies photography, it must own the images or hold a written
  licence, and staff/patient photos need written consent before `approved` is
  set to `true` in `content.json`.
- The template's Unsplash-licensed photos were **not** copied into this project.

## Icons

- **Lucide** icon set — <https://lucide.dev>
  - Licence: **ISC**
  - The small set used here (phone, message, map pin, clock, arrow, check,
    menu, close, etc.) is recreated inline as an SVG sprite in
    `assets/js/main.js`, based on Lucide's 24×24 stroke geometry.

## Typefaces

- **Bricolage Grotesque** by Mathieu Triay — <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Bricolage+Grotesque>
  - Licence: **SIL Open Font License 1.1**
  - Used at 600/700 for headings, service titles and the Lupyana wordmark.
- **Onest** by Dmitry Volkov / Nikita Sapozhkov — <https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Onest>
  - Licence: **SIL Open Font License 1.1**
  - Used at 400/500/600 for body text, navigation, labels, buttons and forms.
- Both are loaded from Google Fonts in each page `<head>`. For a fully offline
  build, self-host the WOFF2 files and remove the Google Fonts links; the CSS
  already falls back to the system sans-serif stack.

## Logo

- The Lupyana Polyclinic logo was supplied by the clinic and is **not** covered
  by the template licence. It is used in these files:
  - `assets/img/logo.png` — full lockup (footer)
  - `assets/img/logo-mark.png` — heart/stethoscope mark (header)
  - `assets/img/favicon-16.png`, `favicon-32.png`, `apple-touch-icon.png`
  - `assets/img/og-image.png` — 1200×630 social share card
- The clinic is responsible for confirming it owns the logo and has permission
  to publish it.

## Software

- No framework, no build step, no runtime dependency.
- Optional local tooling only: Node.js (for `tools/serve.mjs` and
  `tools/sync-content.mjs`).

## Content

- All clinic content is placeholder text owned by Lupyana Polyclinic once
  supplied. English is the source language; Swahili strings remain
  `[SW: …]` markers until a fluent speaker approves them.
- No patient records, histories, diagnoses or prescriptions appear anywhere in
  this project.
